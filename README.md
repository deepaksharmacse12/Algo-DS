## Arrays
1. [Given an array of 2n elements of which n are similar and n are different.](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6655536/given-an-array-of-2n-elements-of-which-n-are-similar-and-n-are-different) => Majority element (Using Mooreâ€™s Voting Algorithm)
2. [Search an element in a sorted and rotated array](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/search-an-element-in-a-sorted-and-pivoted-array/) : 
* [finding the pivot](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-minimum-element-in-a-sorted-and-rotated-array/): Pattern => The minimum element is the only element whose previous element is greater than it. If there is no such element, then there is no rotation and first element is the minimum element.

                                             /
* Most of the solution are when elements are **distinct**, separate solution for **repeating elements**.
